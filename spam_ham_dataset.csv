george ,
there seems to be a problem with mips while trying to actualize
the january 2000 data ( y 2 k related ) . in order to actualize jan
pops has to manually load the actual files into pops , the
side effect of this is that some of the feb data may be loaded
with numbers that are old . this will be rectified as we complete
loading the jan actuals and then load the most recent mips
measured prelim numbers for feb .
pops is currently processing the mips files in the order they
were received , we should be done with this today . please inform
us of any abnormalities that you see tommorrow .

eric bass , texas desk trader , requested the following product described below
be traded on enrononline . this product will not bridge into sitara and will
have to be put in manually .
the reason it will not bridge is due to the fact that it can have multiple
stripes of start & end dates rather than one start & end date . currently ,
enrononline can
only send one start & end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridge
monitor and will have to be manually entered into sitara & subsequently
cleared out of the monitor .
since these transactions could flow next day , it is imperative that these
transactions get into sitara as soon as possible . please read the full
description below . ( this product looks like a month long deal but excludes
weekends . the "" wkd "" is short for week days . )
we do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions but need to be
prepared to react quickly when they do . for the future , we are looking into
the cost / benefit of enrononline having the capability of sending multiple
dates for these types of products .
if you have any questions , please call me at 3 - 5824
thank you .

subject : 24 x 5 products
we are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 nat gas product commencing tomorrow ,
may 24 th .
the product is a month - long physical nat gas product traded off the texas
desk . it will be identified as follows :
us gas phy exxon katy wkd juno 0 usd / mm
this product is different from the usual products traded on the texas desk in
that the product description has an
indicator of wkd , which designates that the product only moves gas on a day
that is a monday , tuesday , wednesday ,
thursday or friday .
these products will not bridge into sitara . risk personnel will need to be
diligent to identify these products based
on the information in the product description to ensure that the products are
entered into sitara correctly ( presumably -
strips of monday - friday trades and the corresponding month - starting days
and / or month - ending days ) .
we understand the potential impact of having to manually input these
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between eol and sitara and consider
building bridge capability . in the
interim , we anticipate that the trading volume on these products will be low ,
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase .

3595,ham,"Subject: sec information / earnings restatement
today we released additional information about our related party and off - balance sheet transactions . we have made this information available both on our website and in a form 8 - k filing with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) .
the information provides further details about :
- - the $ 1 . 2 billion charge to shareholders ' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge ;
- - a restatement of prior years ' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders ' equity , the consolidation of three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications ;
- - the special committee appointed by the enron board of directors to review transactions between enron and related parties ;
- - the ljm limited partnerships , including a discussion of transactions between enron and ljm entities ; and
- - transactions between enron and other enron employees .
this information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec . as our board ' s new special committee continues its review of various matters , we will continue to cooperate fully with the sec in its investigation , and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate , appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses .
restatement of earnings
based on information that we have recently obtained , enron and its auditors determined that certain off - balance sheet entities should have been included in enron ' s consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles . as a result , enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001 . these restatements have no material effect on enron ' s current financial position . here are some details included in the filing :
net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of joint energy development investments ( jedi ) and chewco beginning in november 1997 , the consolidation of an ljml subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments . enron ' s current assessment indicates that the restatement will include :
- - a reduction of approximately $ 96 million in 1997
- - a reduction of approximately $ 113 million in 1998
- - a reduction of approximately $ 250 million in 1999
- - a reduction of approximately $ 132 million in 2000
- - an increase of approximately $ 17 million for the first quarter of 2001
- - an increase of approximately $ 5 million for the second quarter of 2001
- - a reduction of $ 17 million for the third quarter of 2001 .
the consolidation of jedi and chewco also will increase enron ' s debt by approximately $ 711 million in 1997 , $ 561 million in 1998 , $ 685 million in 1999 and $ 628 million in 2000 .
the restatement will have no material impact on enron ' s reported earnings for the nine - month period ending september 2001 .
you can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the form 8 - k filing at .
we will continue to review our strategic , operational and financial position , and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments .",0

this is a statement that was read over the pa system at the football game
at roane county high school , kingston , tennessee by school principal jody
mcloud , on september 1 , 2000 . i thought it was worth sharing with the
world , and hope you will forward it to all your friends . it clearly shows
just how far this country has gone in the wrong direction .
"" it has always been the custom at roane county high school football games
to say a prayer and play the national anthem to honor god and country .
due to a recent ruling by the supreme court , i am told that saying a prayer
is a violation of federal case law .
as i understand the law at this time , i can use this public facility to
approve of sexual perversion and call it an alternate lifestyle , and if
someone is offended , that ' s ok .
i can use it to condone sexual promiscuity by dispensing condoms and
calling it safe sex . if someone is offended , that ' s ok .
i can even use this public facility to present the merits of killing an
unborn baby as a viable means of birth control . if someone is offended , no
problem .
i can designate a school day as earth day and involve students in
activities to religiously worship and praise the goddess , mother earth ,
and call it ecology .
i can use literature , videos and presentations in the classroom that depict
people with strong , traditional christian convictions as simple minded and
ignorant and call it enlightenment .
however , if anyone uses this facility to honor god and ask him to bless
this event with safety and good sportsmanship , federal case law is
violated .
this appears to be inconsistent at best , and at worst , diabolical .
apparently , we are to be tolerant of everything and anyone except god and
his commandments .
nevertheless , as a school principal , i frequently ask staff and students to
abide by rules which they do not necessarily agree . for me to do otherwise
would be inconsistent at best , and at worst , hypocritical . i suffer from
that affliction enough unintentionally . i certainly do not need to add an
intentional transgression .
for this reason , i shall , "" render unto caesar that which is caesar ' s , "" and
refrain from praying at this time . however , if you feel inspired to honor ,
praise and thank god , and ask him in the name of jesus to bless this event ,
please feel free to do so . as far as i know , that ' s not against the law -
yet . ""
and . . . one by one , the people in the stands bowed their heads , held hands
with one another , and began to pray . they prayed in the stands . they prayed
in the team huddles . they prayed at the concession stand . and they prayed
in the announcer ' s box . the only place they didn ' t pray was in the supreme
court of the united states of america - the seat of "" justice "" in the one
nation under god .
somehow , kingston , tennessee , remembered what so many have forgotten . . . we
are given the freedom of religion , not the freedom from religion .
praise god that his remnant remains !
let ' s celebrate jesus in 2001
jesus said , "" if you are ashamed of me , i will be ashamed of you before my
father . ""
- - - - - - - - -
if you are not ashamed , pass this on . . . but only if you mean it .
yes , i do love god . he is my source of existence and savior . he keeps me
functioning each and every day . without him , i will be nothing . without
him , i am nothing but with him , i can do all things through christ that
strengthens me . phil 4 : 13

here ' s the response i got with regards to tomcat . i ' ve place another call
into david and let him know that the information we received included most
points except for tomcat . i ' ll keep you informed .
what i know is that the gas is sourced at mi 587 and moved on km ' s firm
contract . for as long as ces remembers , they sell the gas to entex . entex
chooses the pipe off which they take - - usually midcon - - also , hpl channel , or
tejas . km is invoiced directly . volume is approx . 2395 . the deal with entex
is written up monthly . km pays on a basket of indices . entex pays on the

based on the conversation we had at the meeting last thursday , i am
implementing the following changes to humble gas pipeline and king ranch gas
plant . if you disagree or feel you had a different understanding than the
items below , please be sure to call me asap .
1 . input hplc purchase from hplr liquids at meter 8793 ( hpl / hgpl ) . remove
the 3 rivers gas from the interconnect ticket and input on
the purchase deal .
2 . input hplc sale to hplr liquids at meters 9643 ( kgpl / hpl ) and 12
( kgpl / hgpl ) . remove 3 rivers volumes from the interconnect tickets
at these meters and input on the sales deals appropriately .
3 . change swing parameters for the king ranch contracts to swing on cage
ranch before swinging on 3 rivers gas . this will hopefully allow
the sale for 3 rivers gas to remain at one meter as much as possible .
i will hopefully have all of these changes made by the end of the day , and
have all contracts repathed . it is my understanding that we are implementing
these changes effective feb . lst .
stella , this may or may not effect repathing of the hplc gas at meter 9643 ,

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

2 . oasis and pgev - hpl is using ena ' s capacity

i have had several requests from the ena business groups . now that the
agreement has been finalized , for report lists from your key applications ,
those
being , altra gms and risk works ( there may be others as people become more
aware ) . there will be a need for information for ena to manage contracts as we
go through he transition period . we feel this would be an easier process to
work

through
the transition .

sandi ,
sorry for just now getting back with you . i was out last week .
the rate ( $ . 04 / mmbtu ) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant . the fee will
be adjusted yearly based on cpi .
bob - i could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the
delivered volumes ( actuals or nominations ) . i think we should use actuals
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a
daily basis . we would receive the estimates / actuals on a lag and may have to
purchase gas to offset the imbalance , even though the plant kept the noms at
the 45 , 000 base . i also think that if the plant does increase the nom , they
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less . do
you agree with this ?

when we met regarding the rate for the tenaska gas management agreement , you
guys mentioned that it would be tied to an index - - could you restate for me
how that is to work - - it will start out 4 cents per mmbtu based on the greater
of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual
deliveries to the plant . then the fee will vary month to month ? year to year ?
based on what index ?

it is amazing and yet not surprising how much enron has accomplished in the
first six months of this year . you continue to make it happen . we recognize
that you work hard every day to accomplish enron  , s business goals , and we are
pleased that many of you have shared in the company  , s financial success
through enron stock options .
as you may know , the current employee stock option program ( also known as the
all employee stock option program or aesop ) began in 1994 and provided value
to participants through 2000 . employees who have participated in this
program from its inception have realized a 1 , 119 % increase in the value of
their stock options ( assuming a stock price of $ 70 ) over the life of the
program .
enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package
and a contributing factor to your performance and to enron  , s continued
success . therefore , the enron executive committee and the compensation and
management development committee of the enron board of directors have decided
to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package .
on may 1 , 2000 , the committee approved an employee stock option program for
calendar years 2001 - 2005 ( enronoptions  ) your stock option program ) . it is
expected that enronoptions  ) your stock option program will be granted ,
effective on or about december 29 , 2000 , for those employees who are eligible
on that date ( please see note below ) . the new program , which is subject to
final approval by enron  , s board of directors , is as follows :
? enronoptions  ) your stock option program will give stock options to
eligible full - time and part - time regular employees in domestic and
international companies / locations .
? the grant of non - qualified stock options will equal 25 % of annual base
salary ( 5 % of annual base salary for each year of a 5 - year period ) on
december 29 , 2000 . ( salary calculation and value may vary in some
international locations . )
? the board will grant the stock options on december 29 , 2000 .
? eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated grant
of stock options .
why commit your talent and energy to enron ? enronoptions  ) your stock option
program , among other good reasons  ( that  , s why .
in the coming weeks , you will be receiving more details about enronoptions  )
your stock option program . to provide information and answer your questions ,
we will introduce a special link on the human resources web - site , host
several espeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular
basis . in the meantime , if you have immediate questions , please contact your
human resources representative .
note : in addition to final approval by enron  , s board of directors , granting
of options will be subject to new york stock exchange and state and federal
regulatory requirements . it is expected that enronoptions  ) your stock
option program will be available to most enron employees ; however , some enron
companies  , employees may not be eligible due to legal , accounting , tax , labor
or business issues . as you know , enron changes to meet the needs of the
marketplaces we serve . given that need to change , we will continue to refine
the eligibility for enronoptions  ) your stock option program and will

tenaska iv has been operating without a "" gas agency agreement "" since that
portion of the transition agreement expired on august 31 . we met with sandy
and the texas gas desk on september 28 to firm up commercial terms ( which i
think we generally accomplished for all matters other than the price that
would be charged by the desk ) . should we be concerned with the amount of
time this is taking ? that is , is there any risk we face ( bank - wise or

george ,
gary called me about this shut in situation a few minutes ago , specifically
regarding meter 6722 . this meter is at the tailgate of three rivers ,
therefore , an hpl field employee will not be able to contact the producer
( they probably have no idea where the gas is coming from that goes through
this meter ) .
gary suggested that the deal maker contact these producers verbally , and then
connie sutton will follow up with written notice . per our discussion , since
mary jo and gary are out this afternoon , i am forwarding this message to you .
the concerned contracts are : cody texas , lp , 012 - 64365 - 101 , 96018049 and

here ' s the latest global performance management schedule for ye 2000 and some
friendly reminder tips for you and your direct reports . the system is
scheduled to open for feedback in 35 days . please forward all mid - year 2000
evaluations to janet de la paz at eb 3658 a .
july 31 - oct 13 th development & testing
oct . 2 - 13 th training - hr community
oct 9 - 27 th training - all employees
oct 16 th system opens to hr community
oct . 23 rd system opens for feedback
nov . 17 th system closes for feedback
nov . 20 th prc meetings begin
dec . 15 th prc meetings conclude
jan 4 - 5 th executive committee meeting
reminders
request that employees maintain an updated list of their acheivements and
contributions to your group . tell them the information they forward to you
will better help you in representing them .
the focus of the prc this year will remain on development of the employee and
will emphasize comparing everyone within a particular peer group relative to
everyone else in their peer group .
update your documentation of employee performance and communicate the key
highlights of their performance or lack thereof now with your direct reports
so that the evaluation process creates minimal or no surprises for your
direct report . it is much easier to have a constructive evaluation session
with your direct report if he / she already knows what the key areas of needed
development are . an ideal situation for the supervisor is one in which
employees with performance issues ( can ' t do or won ' t do ) choose to exit the
group voluntarily before the self evident evaluation has to be given .
i will continue to provide updates and reminders as they become available .
let me know if you have any questions .

2386,ham,"Subject: texoma - beaumont hpl maintenance
this is in regard to the maintenance that you want to do at the texoma -
beaumont interconnect ( replace some valves , i believe ) .
we had discussed doing this at a time when mobil beaumont refinery would have
low gas takes . that window of opportunity will be in early to mid february .
mobil will take down some of the units at different times during the month .
some of these units are endothermic , some are exothermic , so in some cases
their gas load goes up when they take certain units down . but based on the
schedule of ups and downs that i ' ve been given , it looks like their gas load
will be at a low point between february 1 and february 12 , at somewhere
around 50 , 000 / d . last we talked about hpl continuing to deliver 20 , 000 / d
through the low pressure meter , and delivering the rest through centana . is
this still the plan ? ?
we met with mobil last year in july to talk to them about what we need to
do : that it would take less than a day , and that during that time , hpl would
deliver some of our gas to them through the centana meter . but that meeting
was a long time ago , and we might need to meet again - you know how
conservative
one thing of concern : in the past two months , we have effected some of our
midcon delivery obligation by delivering 30 , 000 / d gas in kind to mobil
beaumont . so we will not be able to do this during the day that we do our
maintenance .
once you gents let me know what you game plan is and confirm how we ' ll handle
gas flows while we do our work , i ' d like to be the one that initially tells
mobil of our plans and set up the initial meeting . it ' s going to take a lot
of coordination because i can guarantee you that mobil ' s maintenance schedule
will change !

daren & tom ,
beginning with august production , i noticed that big cowboy , into king ranch
appeared to be flowing approximately 9 m over the nomination / day . per a
conversation i had with fred boas today , i discovered that two wells with
zero noms flowed a considerable volume .
they are as follows :

big cowboy # 2 ( 27003 - 84 , 000 approx .
total flow : 126 , 000 mm ' s , more or less

came on in august . please let me know what you think . i would like to make
sure that we are capturing our purchases correctly for both accounting and

in light of december ' s allocation of actual volumes at kcs # 9797 , it looks as
though we need to reduce the nom at both this meter and at tejas riverside ,
# 3543 , where the "" sell "" portion of this buy / sell occurs for the remainder of
january . december actual receipts at # 9797 were 15 , 889 mm or an average of
513 mm / day . the january nomination is 864 mm / day . i think it needs to be
reduced to approx 345 mm / day effective 1 / 11 or there may be a large diffence

bob ,
questions based on the information in the facilitation by location report :
1 . meter 9643 hgpl / hpl - stratton , tejones operating corporation , sitara 266970 : should this purchase be at meter 9638 , freeman prod - maxine field in trade zone 18 ?
2 . i presume we are not counting both meter 9848 north padre island blk 8 and meter 9862 lehman / spinnaker onshore . isn ' t this the same gas ?
3 . meter 3536 seahawk / a - s ( mat plt 520 ) , eog resources , sitara 725391 : is this purchase properly in the wellhead book ?
4 . meter 6884 pgtt junction 16 "" lease , comstock oil & gas , inc . and kerr - mcgee oil & gas onshore l . p . , sitara 125899 and 132975 : comstock ' s volume should exceed kerr - mcgee ' s volume , and together the two volumes should be approximately 73 , 000 / d . currently , comstock ' s volume is only 8 , 600 / d and kerr - mcgee ' s volume is 25 , 000 / d . we look about 38 , 000 / d short .
5 . meter 639 hannah nash , coral energy resources , l . p . , sitara 659998 : is this purchase properly in the wellhead book ?
i ' m looking at about 10 other old deals that i think should be in for may , but aren ' t . in addition , i ' m adding in the new deals that will flow in may . i ' ll be done by noon .

this meter has not been disconnected . the measurement tech turned in a
temporary disconnect to mips ( about 2 months ago ) because the meter has not
flowed for approximately 4 months . this allows the measurement tech to forgo
testing the meter until it is ready to be put back in service . scheduled
volumes should be taken to zero until further notice .

i think we need to remove some of the demand charges that have been set up
for williams and apache . on williams deal 384237 , the demand charge needs to
be removed from sept . 2000 . the demand charge should not have started until
october 2000 . because we did not know at the time what was happening with
this deal , the demand fee was inadvertently paid to williams for sept . and we
need to recoup our money . on apache deal 384247 , james thinks we need to
remove the demand charge completely . he says it is not a part of the deal
and apache is not billing us for it . we also need to talk about the pricing
on both of these deals . williams and apache are billing us less than what we
have in sitara . to be able to keep this desk at zero , jim pond does not want
me to use pay the lesser of for the purchases , so we need to address the
price differences . you said you had some contract briefs that supported our
prices . please fax a copy to me at 713 - 646 - 8420 and i will compare them to
what james has .
just a heads up . . . we are beginning to work on november 2000 , so we will need

subject : re : koch midstream services co
since koch has told you that they sold the properties to duke , i would say
that duke should be paying us for the gas .
i had heard that koch sold the properties to another counterparty , but i
wasn ' t sure to whom . i either talked or left a message with someone in the
settlements area about two months ago about this after koch informed the
trader that they should not be getting the invoices . however , i never heard
back from anyone .
this is related to the ces acquisition which came online the first of this
year . the deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to koch . i can
change the tickets in sitara to the duke counterparty ( or create new tickets )
today if you need me to , so that we can get the invoice out the door . you
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct
contract in place for the deal .

subject : koch midstream services co
i have been billing koch midstream services co under ena for meters
ll - 1 - 0030 - comitas ( sitara # 144052 ) and ll - 1 - 0027 - volpe ( sitara # 144049 ) . my
former accounting contact at koch , michael thomas , said that koch sold these
south texas assets to duke energy field services back in 1999 . michael faxed
a contract which i forwarded to cindy balfour flannigan in the contract
area . cindy said she can ' t tie the deals in the contract to our system so
she can ' t recognize the assignment . cindy has left messages with koch , but
she has not been able to resolve the issue . koch is refusing to pay for
the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to
these deals . i need to find out whether koch or duke is responsible for
paying for this gas . do you have any information regarding this issue ?
thanks ,

tom , does your group have any dealings with acacia natural gas ? it ' s a texas intrastate owned by mitchell . they have made a filing for approval of section 311 rates for interruptible service and they have set up their operating conditions so their affiliate will get higher priority over other parties who are paying the same rate ( priority within the same rate will be based on whoever has the earliest transportation agreement ) .
would appreciate hearing from you in the next day or so . comments are due on the filing by nov . 7 th , and if we want to protest , we ' ll have to get our facts together .

i have some information on the e - workorders ( ehurr and ehset ) that were set
up to track the costs of bridgeline . apparently the workorders themselves
were not set up correctly so no costs could be coded to them in msa . we have
corrected the workorder set - ups and they should be working now . as for prior
costs , i think we will be able to get a list of all the payroll costs that we
attempted to code to ehurr and ehset , and then book an entry in april that
would reclass them to the workorders . we would then be able to see all the
costs associated with the project , as you wanted to do from the beginning ,
and code any future costs directly to the workorders . i will let you know
more when i finalize that this can really be done , i just wanted to keep you

to all employees :
this morning enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses :
- - we filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the u . s . bankruptcy code . contrary to popular belief , this does not mean we are out of business . what it does mean is that we have entered into a court - supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses , reorganize our finances , and explore various strategic , operational and financial alternatives , including the sale of non - core assets , in an orderly manner .
- - in connection with our filing for chapter 11 reorganization , enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor - in - possession ( dip ) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly . upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements , the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement enron ' s existing capital and help the company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business , including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today ' s filing .
- - we filed a lawsuit against dynegy , alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for dynegy ' s wrongful termination of our proposed merger . we are asking the court for damages of not less than $ 10 billion .
- - we also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company ' s wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure . as contemplated , this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from enron ' s current wholesale energy trading team , and will conduct counterparty transactions through enrononline .
these are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business . from an operational standpoint , our energy businesses - including our pipelines , utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world , and will continue to do so .
as you know , the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost - savings program . this will entail a significant reduction in our work force . this is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day tuesday , though in some cases notification will take longer .
for our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process , you will remain on the company payroll for now . in addition , we will submit a severance pay plan to the bankruptcy court for approval . this approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits . we will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the court has made its determination .
i know these actions raise new questions about our company ' s future and what this means for each of us . your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on monday to discuss these events with you . in addition , you can access a copy of the press release on . we will also have a q & a and other materials for you on monday . while there is a great deal we simply don ' t know yet , we hope these materials will help answer at least some of your questions .
when decisions are made affecting our company , people , and operations , we will let you know as quickly as possible . there is still considerable value and opportunity in our business . the strategic restructuring process that we are beginning will allow us to preserve that value and those opportunities .
on behalf of the board and entire management team , we greatly appreciate your patience , your professionalism and whatever support you can offer each other as we navigate through these tough times to a better future .

in most cases , ena will be a net buyer from tenaska iv for activity related
to the cleburne plant . however , for october 2000 , the plant was down the
majority of the month and ena sold off the supply , resulting in ena owing
money to tenaska iv .
i have created deal 529856 with a demand of $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , which is the
calculated amount of income on the cleburne desk . ( please see the attached
schedule . ) we need to pass this income on to tenaska iv . do we need to pay
this amount ( wire from ena to tenaska iv ) or is there another way to do
this ? this is the case for october 2000 and could possibly happen again in
the future .
greg , troy , jim - please let me know what you think about settling this .
megan - don ' t pay the amount until we here from the greg , troy and jim .
also , make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we

subject : tenaska iv 10 / 00
we have actuals . the larger of the two volumes is 1 , 395 , 000 , which is
45 , 000 / day , so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine . i am having a
problem , though , with the way it is coming to settlements . it is showing up
with a jan 2003 delivery date . i think the demand fee needs to be on 10 / 1
only . right now , it is on a line with a date of 10 / 1 / 00 to 12 / 31 / 36 . i
think this is confusing the system some how . also , we still need the
purchase deal for tenaska iv . it should be for a demand fee of $ 2 , 571 , 135 . 73
booked to the cleburne desk . we actually owe $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , but i need to
net the tenaska iv sales with the purchase to clear those receivables . james
is calling me every day asking for an update . do you know when we will be
able to get this in the system ? i have attached my spreadsheet so you can
see the numbers .

development corporation is a business development company registered with the
sec and governed by the 1940 investment company act . abdv has interests in
several portfolio companies . abdv has placed acquired multi media assets
valued at $ 3 . 7 million into e - direct , inc . , abdv . s wholly owned subsidiary .
e - direct has generated over $ 100 , 000 in revenue during its first full month of

as a business development
company , abdv seeks out companies that show promise and are in need of raising
capital and require accounting and managerial assistance . it is the intention
of abdv to build a portfolio of companies in diverse industries . vkdqkgxdjmtnnh

from actual press releases : yjycunv
red bank , n . j . , aug 24 , 2004 ( primezone
via comtex ) - - the following is a letter from john
figliolini , president of atlantis business development
corporation , inc . ( otcbb : ) . ldgkcpf
dear shareholder , addlrko
i am writing to you today to
discuss the new direction which your company will be
heading . up until this point we made it clear that
abdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of
the market . our basic premise was to seek out
companies that can be turned into positive cash flow
businesses with the proper equity investment made into
them by abdv . fine wein records is an example of that ;
with a financial commitment of $ 250 , 000 by abdv we
expect fine wein to be able to throw off significant
positive cash flow over the next 12 months from the
various projects they are currently working on .
e - direct is another example ; we should start to see
some meaningful positive cash flow developing and
continuing over the next 12 months . however , abdv has
not maintained a particular industry focus . as of
today that has changed . wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir
last week we announced that abdv
will be providing $ 1 , 000 , 000 in equity financing to
future quest , inc . ( pink sheets : ) ,
a company in the oil gas sector , this was the start
of our new direction . abdv will be dedicated in
locating and provide managerial , accounting and
financing for companies in the energy field , from oil
and gas companies to alternative energy companies . jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft
you may ask ; why the energy
related field ? simply it currently offers many
opportunities and with the price of oil approaching
$ 50 per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth
to be made in this sector . according to adjusted
inflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak
of $ 73 from the 1970 s . however , unlike the oil crisis
of the past , we are looking at what will be a problem
to stay with us for a long time . simply put the demand
for oil world wide has increased by some 2 . 5 % this
year alone , most of which is because of china . the
increase in oil prices is not a fade which once the
bubble bursts will result in oil back in the $ 20 - 30
level . we are looking at a trend that is now cemented
in stone . there are more players in the world economy
today that require oil gas to propel their own
economies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at
these higher levels . abdv has already aligned itself
with individuals that have experience in the energy
field . these individuals will help locate viable
opportunities and the funding necessary to participate
in these opportunities . wtxrxayfisoira
so what do we do with our
non - energy related businesses such as fine wein
records and e - direct ? well , first of all we will
continue to incubate and nurture these businesses
until they are at a level where they can move on their
own . i believe that both of these companies will be
strong viable businesses in 12 months from now . at
that point i will recommend to abdv ' s board of
directors that we spin - off these two businesses to our
shareholders . this strategy is in keeping with the
basic premise of our business module whereby we share
the wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing
public our portfolio companies . we can then continue
to concentrate in the energy - related field . lvxhkmblmcewrw
by concentrating on a specific
sector such as the energy area we will be able to
define abdv ' s purpose and guide it like a laser . our
goal will be to locate and make investments in no less
than four energy - related businesses over the next 12
months . i believe that by maintaining this focus an
investment in abdv will be looked at as an innovative
way to participate in the booming oil gas and
energy - related fields . twqssqlqqkvbdm

minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card
playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on
its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning .
the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season .
government spokesman raanan gissin
said four soldiers were killed .
six people were taken to hospital - -
four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military
sources said .
the sources said another soldier
remained beneath the rubble .
gissin said rescue operations were
continuing sunday night .
the attack "" indicates that unless
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards
political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . ""
shortly after the first blast , a
second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not
immediately known .
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called
the fatah hawks .
there was no immediate information
available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat .
israeli military sources said it was
a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the
post when the explosives were detonated .
it was not clear whether there were
palestinian casualties .
news video of the aftermath showed
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely
wounded .
in a pamphlet distributed after the
attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of
the incident .
palestinians have used tunnels in the
area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack
down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard
an israeli tank shell exploded in a
gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren ,
palestinian medical and security sources said .
the children between the ages of 6
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said .
the violence happened in khan yunis
in central gaza
israeli military sources said that
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby .
in response , the forces fired towards
the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military
sources said .",1

good day ,
i am kingsley muntu , decillion finacial services south africa . this is an urgent and confidential business proposition .
on june 14 , 2000 , a foreign consultant with the global oil corporation ,
mr . alan baker made a numbered time ( fixed ) deposit for twelve calendar
months , valued at us $ 8 , 320 , 000 . 00 , with us . upon maturity . i sent a routine
notification to his forwarding address but got no reply . after a month , a
reminder was sent and finally it was discovered from his contract employers ,
global oil corporation that mr . baker passed away .
on further investigation , i found out that he died without making a will
or a testament , and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless . i also discovered that mr . baker did not declare any kin or
relations in any of his official documents , including his deposit paperwork
in my possession . this has been fixed under our management . no one will ever
come forward to claim it .
consequently , my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand
in as the beneficiary to this investment . i am writing to you because i
cannot operate a foreign account . i want to present you as the beneficiary
of the funds so that you claim on my behalf with the help of my attorney .
please provide me with your full names and address so that my attorney
prepares the necessary documents , which will put you in place as the
beneficiary to this investment .
please observe utmost confidentiality , and be rest assured that this
transaction will be of mutual benefit , as you will be entitled to 30 % of the money and the remaining 70 % for my own investment . if you are
interested , reply me by email for further details .

this one appears tame , smith said ,

approach it , nor should they run away from the animal since that could provoke a

authorities , he g to tales circulating the wooded neighborhood off , the animal
walked up to a man as he was swinging his toddler in the back yard . the cat is
said to have lunged at the child . as the story goes , the man fended it off with

on their back deck for a while looking in , just like at the in another tale on a
different street , a teenage baby sitter was at the backyard pool with an
8 - year - old boy and his cousin . the cat sneaked up on them from behind , and she
jumped into the pool with the boy . they swam to the other side , but it followed

investor alert newsletter - april issue issue 2005
gbic is set to soar this monday !
in april ' s issue we are going to profile a stock that is very much undervalued
and has just started trading . ground floor opportunity for everybody .
this small treasure is : gbic ( gulf biomedical corp )
the stock is trading at only 20 cents and we expect it will hit 50 - 60 cents in
the second week of april
huge pr campaign expected this week so grab as much as you can up to 45 - 55 cents
range
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
stock symbol : gbic
current price : $ 0 . 19
we expect the price to go to 50 - 60 cents in next 2 - 3 days
we expect the price to go to 80 cents in next 2 weeks .
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
there are some very positive news expected next week so act before that : )
about the company :
60 - million americans are losing - or have already lost - their hair . they are
mostly men , but also a substantial number of women . most of that 60 - milloin wish
they had it back . gulf biomedical corporation ( gbic ) has a breakthrough product
that will help them . no , it will really help them .
there are thousands of products and services promising to do the same thing ,
until you read the fine print . the fine print says , "" this doesn ' t work for
everybody . "" it says , "" results may take four months or more to appear . "" it says ,
"" beware of the side effects . "" it says , "" a long term contract is required . ""
gbic has hairmagict . there is no fine print . hairmagict says , plain and simple :
"" hairmagict grows hair . easily . painlessly . inexpensively - for less than $ 2 a
day . results in 4 weeks , or your money back . ""
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
stock symbol : gbic
current price : $ 0 . 19

we expect the price to go to 80 cents in next 2 weeks .
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
the product :
the product is hairmagictand it grows hair . no , it really grows hair . how
important is that ?
an estimated 60 million american men and women ( yes , women too ) are losing - or
have already lost - their hair . most of them would give anything to have it
back . people do ridiculous things to look like they have hair when they really
don ' t . funny ? sure , if you have a full head of hair . if you don ' t , you would
probably pay any amount for something that could actually grow hair on your
head .
that ' s what the experts call a "" market ! ""
now , you ' ve seen all the ads . they are full of hair - growing promises , plus
warnings that their product doesn ' t work for everybody , and beware of the side
effects . one promises the buyer will see results , if any , in four months . all of
them cost a veritable fortune .
now , finally , there ' s a hair - growing product that actually grows hair , and
hairmagict guarantees to start doing so in 4 weeks or less , or give you a 100 %
refund . and , incredibly , hairmagictsells for less than $ 2 a day .

delta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxpp
controls 6 properties totaling 7 , 554 acres ( approximately 11 sq .
miles ) in montana . another 10 , 000 acres of prospective diamond and
gold properties are controlled in bolivia , south america . ( source :
company website ) currently trading at . 012 p
possibilty of an absolutely huge week as massive pr campaign has
started and is expected to last all week . pp
imagine how well your portfolio would have done the last month or so
if you had the scoop on the following stock : p
( otcbb : mbah ) : this stock closed at . 01 on september lst . this
little giant closed at . 06 on october 8 th , up 500 % in about 5
weeks . do you think ibm is going to move like that anytime soon ? p
as many of you may agree , some , not all , of these stocks move in
price because they are promoted , making a very large number of
investors aware of the stock . the awareness is underway on dmxp ! pp
let ' s look at the company , delta mining and exploration corp .
otc : dmxpp
about the company : p
delta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxp is a mineral exploration
company that controls 6 properties totaling 7 , 554 acres
( approximately 11 sq . miles ) in montana . the properties are all
located over what management considers to be some of the most
prospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states .
another 10 , 000 acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are
controlled in bolivia , south america . initial work has revealed
that the bolivian properties display similar potential to those
found in north america . p
the management team is led by chief executive officer , dr . barry
rayment , who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration
company to the next level . dr . rayment brings 32 years of
experience in the field of geology , along with running some of the
most successful mining companies in the industry . dr . rayment was
the president of bema gold corp . , ( amex : bgo ) , a company with a
market cap of close to a billion dollars . he was also affiliated
with glamis gold , gold fields mining and amselco exploration ( bp
minerals ) , among others . his vast experience in the mining sector
along with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an
extraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company
moves forward . p
among the support team is stephen kay , a geologist with more than 30
years experience in exploration throughout europe , south africa ,
south america and the united states . while with gold fields mining
corp . , stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent
drilling of the 3 million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california . p
delta has experienced significant technical success since its
start - up in 1997 . for example , delta has discovered the first
in - situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead
kimberlite , southeast of lewistown . the company also controls part
of the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown
the three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator
minerals - a major step toward finding the presence of economic
diamonds - including pyrope ( garnet ) , chromite and clinoprroxene . p
an aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to
discover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this
under - explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing
kimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta , canada . p
in bolivia , delta controls approximately two - thirds of a highly
prospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia
group of concessions covering 7 , 860 acres ( 12 sq miles ) . the other
one - third is presently being explored by de beers . in addition to
the independencia property delta controls more than 2 , 000 acres
comprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays
all the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further
exploration is justified . p
delta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing
its extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also
by acquiring additional diamond properties . delta will focus on
identifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining
companies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and
finance additional exploration . p
in addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta
controls , they also control a gold property with great potential .
the property is near la paz in bolivia , where initial analysis
revealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an
extensive exploration program . pp
( source : company website ) p
recent headlines : go online and read the full stories ! p
delta mining and exploration corp . is invited to attend a
conference with the bolivian chamber of commerce . p
delta mining and exploration corp . visits homestead property in
preparation of work program . p
delta mining and exploration corp . discloses preliminary gold
exploration findings in south america . p
delta mining and exploration , corp . looks to continue diamond
exploration in south america . pp
will dmxp explode higher as more and more investors become aware of
the stock this weekend and next week ? if you think so , you may not
want to wait until it is too late . remember , timing your trade is
critical . good luck and happy trading . pp

finally !
i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex ,
even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really
wants is an extra inch !
3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving
the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft .
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original
size . i was really surprised !
i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5
after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long !
the lengthening is permanent !
i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it
again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best
product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i
forget !
take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if
you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your
money back . every penny . no - one sends them back !

minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card
playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on
its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning .
the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season .
government spokesman raanan gissin
said four soldiers were killed .
six people were taken to hospital - -
four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military
sources said .
the sources said another soldier
remained beneath the rubble .
gissin said rescue operations were
continuing sunday night .
the attack "" indicates that unless
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards
political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . ""
shortly after the first blast , a
second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not
immediately known .
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called
the fatah hawks .
there was no immediate information
available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat .
israeli military sources said it was
a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the
post when the explosives were detonated .
it was not clear whether there were
palestinian casualties .
news video of the aftermath showed
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely
wounded .
in a pamphlet distributed after the
attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of
the incident .
palestinians have used tunnels in the
area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack
down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard
an israeli tank shell exploded in a
gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren ,
palestinian medical and security sources said .
the children between the ages of 6
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said .
the violence happened in khan yunis
in central gaza
israeli military sources said that
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby .
in response , the forces fired towards
the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military
sources said .",1

these pills are just like regular cialis but they are specially formulated
to be soft and dissolvable under the tongue . the pill is absorbed at the mouth
and enters the bloodstream directly instead of going through the stomach .
this results in a faster more powerful effect which still lasts up to 36 hours .
cialis soft tabs also have less sidebacks ( you can drive or mix alcohol drinks with cialis ) .

i was skeptical when i ordered your product .
i was a smoker for 32 years and had tried everything . on april 17 th
at 12 : 00 pm , i finished my last cigarette in my last pack . after taking the first 2 pills ,
i have not touched another cigarette . on march 15 , 1991 i turned 35 years old .
6 days later i had a severe heart attack . after in the hospital for 9 days i walked
out and started smoking again . i sat with my dad for a year till he died of lung
cancer in 1997 and i still smoked even as i watched him waste away .
until i started fina lsmoke i felt that within 5 years i ' d be dead and gone .
but now i feel alive again . more energy and even happier than i have been in years .
and i owe it all to you and your great product . you have changed my life forever
and for that i can never repay you . thank you . - ronnie davenport oklahoma city , ok
exactly what i needed . . . this is a great system ! i knew cigarettes were packed
with poisons but i didn ' t know just how many or what kind there were !
the final smoke capsules were the best . every time i lit up a cigarette ,
i threw it away before half of it was smoked , usually only 2 - 3 puffs .
it made me feel sick and nauseous to smoke these poisons !
this is exactly what i needed to help me stop ! i ' ve been trying
to quit for the past 7 years , i tried everything under the sun with no results .
with final smoke i was smoke free in under a month ! - e . okamura , hawaii
